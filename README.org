* Supercollider Documentation in Org-mode

Emacs/Org-Mode + Supercollider = ??

The current version of SCIDE (say, for 3.9.3) has much to recommend it. For some users, of course, the main drawback is simply that it is not Emacs with Org-mode!

How might one address that (admittedly persnickety) discrepancy? Here are some initial attempts to rethink the organization of existing Supercollider documentation, tutorials and examples while relying on Org-mode for...too much?

Some ideas or TODOs:

- Tag all Ugen class documentation blocks and break up "sound-making" examples.

- Add in Tour of the Ugens in org-mode

- Incorporate the great stuff in ./examples/demonstrations and ./examples/pieces
